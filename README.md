# Set-AzDoRepoPermission
Create or edit git securityrules on Azure Devops Organizations, Projects, or branches using PowerShell / Azure DevOps API.

You can use this instead of having to get the tf.exe tool as documented in the Azure DevOps [Require branch folders](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/require-branch-folders?view=azure-devops&tabs=browser) page.

Tested on powershell 7.2.1 on windows, but should probably work on Powershell 7 on any platform.
